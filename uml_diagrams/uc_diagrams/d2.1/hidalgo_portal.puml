    usecase SCOPOR001 <<check>> as "
    Portal Development
    --
    Provide access to multiple services via web-based GUI. 
    Implement multiple services for the users of the portal. 
    Ease the technical details by abstracting the technical 
    complexity, with the proper mechanisms running in the background
    "

    usecase SCOPOR002 <<check>> as "
    Development and maintenance of orchestration HPC plugin
    --
    Deploy, submit, monitor, and revert HPC jobs with simple 
    unified notion of orchestration blueprints. 
    Arguably simpler way to work with HPC clusters 
    for end-users, unified interface for accessing HPC resources 
    required to integrate marketplace
    "

    usecase SCOPOR003 <<check>> as "
    Support external pilots
    --
    HiDALGO2 deals with five pilot use cases. 
    Potentially, the portal should be capable to deal 
    with other, external pilots. New stakeholders 
    should be able to execute their applications in the portal.
    "

    usecase SCOPOR004 as "
    Analyse and define HiDALGO2 workflows
    --
    Analyse and define workflows demanded by all project pilots.
    "

    usecase SCOPOR005 as "
    Enable scalable and resilient Workflow Management System
    --
    The portal needs to execute workflows of pilots and 
    other use cases by means of the current state-of-the-art. 
    Execution should be highly scalable, failure tolerant, 
    secure and reliable.
    "

    usecase SCOPOR006 as "
    Interfacing data management
    --
    Storage, serve and manage datasets. 
    Import data from outside sources, explore data, 
    visualize data, serve data for processing. 
    Will be usable by experts at any stage of scenario 
    handling to provide input data for processing 
    and save output data afterwards

    "

    usecase SCOPOR007 as "
    Execution Monitoring
    --
    In order to know if the execution is progressing 
    and even to know some of the intermediate results 
    as they are being obtained during the execution. 
    The user needs to know how the application is progressing 
    to determine if there has been a mistake in the initial 
    parameters or they should be changed.
    "

    usecase SCOPOR008 as "
    3D-visualization of CFD data
    --
    Visualize 3D spatial variables, both scalar and vector 
    valued functions in a moving time frame (with videos), 
    cross sections or in innovative ways efficiently, 
    be able to visualize from each module of the workflow
    "

    usecase SCOPOR009 as "
    Web-based visualization
    --
    Visualize simulation results for validation

    "

    usecase SCOPOR010 as "
    Visualization for data of intermediate workflow steps
    --
    Visualizations for data at different stages of the workflow are available. 
    The data-in-process can be inspected and manually analysed.
