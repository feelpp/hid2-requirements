    usecase SCODAAI001 <<check>> as "
    Integration of data analytics notebook frameworks
    --
    Provide data exploration, sharing, collaboration 
    and visualization. Used by data scientists for 
    carrying out datasets processing and visualization
    "

    usecase SCODAAI002 <<check>> as "
    Simulation support with AI & ML methods
    --
    Methods of AI and ML should be implemented in order 
    to support the simulations (e.g. feature extraction 
    of input data, parameter estimation).
    "

    usecase SCODAAI003 <<check>> as "
    Enhance simulations with streaming data
    --
    Enable additional pilot applications to fetch 
    and process streaming data whenever required. 
    "

    usecase SCODAAI004 as "
    Component testing and validation
    --
    Implementation partners should be able to test their 
    implementations and in the use case so that the 
    functionality of the component under test can be evaluated.
    "

    usecase SCODAAI005 as "
    Smart assistant for interactive analytical workflows
    --
    Receive suggestions on how to complete analytical tasks 
    that include visual and algorithmic steps. 
    See a visual result preview for analytical workflows, 
    which are suggested based on the data and/or user behavior. 
    Select a preview to activate a ”wizard” for executing that workflow. 
    Make interactive data analysis more accessible to non-experienced users 
    by providing suggestions and guidance.
    "

    usecase SCODAAI006 as "
    Seamless and in-situ data analytics on HPDA servers
    --
    Use and extend data analytics, available on HPDA servers; 
    seamlessly integrate simulation software and data analytics 
    software, avoid time-consuming operations of copying 
    big amounts of data, usable by GSS community.
    "

    usecase SCODAAI007 <<check>> as "
    HPDA application deployment and support
    --
    Support the running and management of applications 
    that have both DA and HPC workflow components. 
    This is used by application providers and developers.
